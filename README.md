# Custom Iroh Protocol for integrating Beelay/Keyhive

> [!CAUTION]
> This is an experiment, proof of concept, integrating rapidly developing technologies. It should not be relied on for Production!  

This library's goal is to wrap the functionality of the early Beelay/Keyhive protocols to showcase a custom Iroh Protocol.  Using Iroh as the network layer, synchronization of Beelay state is achieved across Iroh nodes to exchange messages.
